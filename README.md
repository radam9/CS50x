	 - Scratch file used for the [MIT's scratch language](https://scratch.mit.edu/) .
 
 2. **set 1**
 
	- **``cash.c``**: C program that applies the "Greedy Algorithm" to calculate minimum coins for change.
	- **``credit.c``**: C program that uses "Luhn's Algorithm" to check for different credit card types.
	- **``hello.c``**: C program that prints response using user input.
	- **``mario.c``**: C program that prints a super mario obstacle.

3. **set 2**

	- **``readability.c``**: C program that uses the "Coleman-Liau index" to calculate the complexity (grade level) of a user text input.
	- **``substitution.c``**: C program that applied a "Substitution Cipher" to encrypt a user text and key input.

4. **set 3**

	- **``plurality.c``**: C program that implements a "Plurality" election system.
